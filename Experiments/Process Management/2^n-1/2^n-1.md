## 2^n-1 Process 

### `createChildProcesses` Function
- This function takes an integer `n` as its argument.
- It checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If so, it returns, as no more child processes should be created.

- If `n` is greater than 0, it calls the `fork()` system call to create a new child process.
  - If `fork()` returns a negative value, an error occurred, and an error message is printed using `perror`, and the program exits with an error code.
  - If `fork()` returns 0, it means this is the child process. The child process prints its PID (Process ID), calls `createChildProcesses` recursively with `n-1` to create additional child processes, and then exits.
  - If `fork()` returns a positive value (the PID of the child process), this is the parent process. The parent process waits for the child process to complete using `wait(NULL)`.

### `main` Function
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program.
- It checks if the number of command-line arguments is not equal to 2 (the program name and 'n'). If the argument count is not 2, it prints a usage message and returns an error code.
- It converts the second command-line argument (`argv[1]`) to an integer `n` using `atoi`.
- It checks if `n` is less than 1. If `n` is less than 1, it prints an error message and returns an error code.
- Finally, it calls `createChildProcesses(n - 1)` to start creating child processes, subtracting 1 from `n` to ensure the correct total number of processes is created.

Overall, this code is a simple example of creating a binary tree of processes, where each process creates two child processes until a specified depth (`n`) is reached. The parent process waits for all child processes to complete before exiting.
