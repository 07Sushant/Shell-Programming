# File Manipulation Programs

This repository contains three simple C programs that demonstrate basic file manipulation using system calls. Each program showcases a different aspect of working with files in a terminal environment.

## Program 1: Copying First Half of a File

- **File:** `copy_first_half.c`
- **Description:** This program reads the content of an input file, calculates its size, and then copies the first half of the content to an output file.
- **Usage:** Replace `"input.txt"` with your input file's name. Compile and run the program to generate `"output_first_half.txt"` with the copied content.

## Program 2: Copying Second Half of a File

- **File:** `copy_second_half.c`
- **Description:** This program reads an input file, skips to the middle, and then copies the remaining content to an output file.
- **Usage:** Replace `"input.txt"` with your input file's name. Compile and run the program to generate `"output_second_half.txt"` with the copied content.

## Program 3: Reading File Contents Without Char Array

- **File:** `read_without_array.c`
- **Description:** This program directly reads and displays the content of an input file without using a character array for buffering.
- **Usage:** Replace `"input.txt"` with your input file's name. Compile and run the program to display the content on the console.

Feel free to explore and use these programs to understand fundamental file manipulation concepts using system calls in the C programming language.
