I am a fearless youth,
The pride of the Nav INDIAN ARMY, in truth.
They call me the glory of the platoon,
Discipline defines me, even under the moon.

In me, there's a zeal that never declines,
I never lose my focus, I never resign.
Discipline, it's my very first stair,
Generations follow, because I dare.

Service is my ultimate devotion,
Friendship with the mountain folk, a deep emotion.
All around, the impact of terror I face,
To eradicate terror, it's my bounden grace.

I have an unwavering enthusiasm to rise,
I work tirelessly, never in disguise.
Crushing the enemy, their every endeavor,
In times of joy, the tricolor flag I hoist forever.

Babban, a year of my proud history,
Never reduced to mere mockery.
Fulfilling duties with unwavering fast,
Life spent like Ram's exile, unsurpassed.

My desire is to touch the sky so high,
In battles, with enemies, I'll stand by.
Like the free winds, I'll roam and soar,
Like rivers, I'll surge and strive for more.

Honesty, in every home, I'm revered,
As if nothing else in the world is endeared.
I take pride in my nation and Assam Rifles too,
Nav Assam Rifles, I'm a symbol anew.
